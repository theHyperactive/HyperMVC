HyperMVC
========

HyperMVC is a small MVC library for rapid prototype staging or setting up small dynamic pages and apps.

<p style="padding: 5px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #d9edf7;">This is a small codeiginter like "framework" following the MVC programming paradigm. It's primary purpose is to help setting up small staging examples that we use in creating prototypes of web applications and/or dynamic websites, or it can be used to quickly set up basic ground for a MVC like application. The idea was to eliminate the need to rewrite the same kind of router, database wrapper and view classes over and over again, and yet to avoid big footprints and overhead that standard frameworks have.</p>

There are no security checks when inputing data, except standard PDO injection protection and no error handling for various states. They will be or will not be integrated in the future.</p>
